# Personal note

Where did cryptocurrency come from? Satoshi Nakamoto? While that may be, I wasn’t personally satisfied with that answer and started to dig past into history, from the first few forks of bitcoin into the 90s, 80s and finally 70s. I realised that this was something bigger than we realised. It was a piece of the bigger puzzle. Cryptocurrency is simply another part of this movement that had begun in the 70s. A movement about digital liberty and freedom.

This book looks to dive into the historical and ideological context of cryptocurrency and the culture in which it hails from. We will be exploring the invention of public key cryptography in the 70s, the work of David Chaum in the 80s, the cryptowars of the 90s and how these periods laid the ground works for our modern day inception of cryptocurrency. Before Bitcoin It invites readers to see the bigger picture of the technological revolution that we are currently experiencing.
