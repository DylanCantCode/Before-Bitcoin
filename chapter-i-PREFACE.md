Beneath the heave of public interest and speculation around cryptocurrencies, there lies an untold narrative of technology and a humanist fight for a better future.

‘Before Bitcoin’ delves into the stories of the people responsible for Bitcoin, the ideological roots of cryptoanarchy and the historical events that have lead up to the conception as well as need for cryptocurrency. I wrote it to impress the understanding of the bigger picture to readers. To share an appreciation for the underlying movement that Bitcoin is a part of. To zoom out of the day to day and see the world with a decade long horizon. 

If you want to understand the bigger picture of what Bitcoin is a part of then, your patience invested will grant you the ability to do so. You may even feel what I felt when I stumbled upon the contents of this book: Hope and an reignited belief in humanity.
